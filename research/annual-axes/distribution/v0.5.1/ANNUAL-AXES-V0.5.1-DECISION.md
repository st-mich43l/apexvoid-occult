# Annual Axes V0.5.1 Decision

auditIntegrityVersion: 2

## Status: NO VARIANT APPROVED

**Selected variant:** null
**Baseline reproduced:** true (51 metrics)
**Evidence bias detected (training AND holdout):** true

## A. Observed result

- Positive latent bias (both splits): true
- Training positive latent rate: 73.3%
- Holdout positive latent rate: 74.2%
- Retained support/pressure mass ratio: 1.404
- Global score median: 57.10

## B. Mechanical funnel finding

- pressureRelativeRetentionGap: -0.0044
- pressureRetentionDiagnosis: no-material-mechanical-retention-gap
- Support final retention: 72.3%
- Pressure final retention: 71.9%

## C. Root-cause inference

**root-cause-unresolved** (confidence: low)

- positive latent bias exists on training and holdout
- aggregate pressure retention is close to support retention
- retained support mass exceeds pressure mass
- the current audit cannot yet distinguish knowledge imbalance from subgroup mechanical imbalance

## V0.5.1 routing

No V0.5.1 analyzer — audit artifacts only.

## Prohibited post-processing

No UI stretching, per-chart centering, global pressure multipliers, or score
post-processing were applied. All scores derive from the V0.5 evidence pipeline.
